	<!-- In order to define a correct structure for documents, Twitter Bootstrap defines several classes that will detail and define how information is going to be displayed in the page. 
	Bootstrap divides a webpage in a Grid system with 12 columns. Those columns can be grouped to organize the content in the webpage. That grouping of information and the way that all the webpage is organized is called Wireframing. Several examples of wireframes can be found in http://www.wireframeshowcase.com/
	For more information about the Grid system one should check http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/scaffolding.html-->

	<!-- The basic element of the Twitter Bootstrap Grid System is the container. Note that in HTML to declare a Grid class one should use the <div class="****"></div> element. All contents of the webpage should be put inside a container -->

	<div class="container">
		<!-- As in every Grid system, we need both columns and rows, so the row will be the next element to be declared. Inse the rows we will then define how we want the information to be organized in our webpage.
		The wireframing used in this example is the following:

				<p> Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum. </p>
